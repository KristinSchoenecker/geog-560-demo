# geog-560-demo
A short demo of a project I've started as I've learned how to use R

This project demonstrates how to prepare text for analysis using R. The script was informed by the 'Text Mining with Bag-of-Words in R' course (Kwartler, n.d.) and the 'Analyzing Social Media Data in R' course (Vivek and Vijayaraghavan, n.d.) in DataCamp.

In order to follow along, download the R script file and the CSV file from this repository. Make sure that you have R and R Studio installed on your computer.
